# Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio! 

I am dedicated to democratising cybersecurity, ensuring that effective security practices and principles are easily accessible to all, particularly small-to-medium enterprises that are often overlooked. Security is frequently treated as a luxury, despite its critical importance to these organisations. Furthermore, providers have traditionally underserved this market, resulting in a lack of tailored support that is essential for these businesses.

By sharing these resources, I aim to empower underserved communities and businesses, creating a more inclusive environment where essential security practices are widely understood and adopted. Together, we can help ensure that everyone has the opportunity to protect their digital assets effectively.

As I continue to grow and learn in the cybersecurity field, I will regularly add interesting and diverse artifacts to this repository that I have found useful. My aim is to create a comprehensive library of high-quality, practical code and documentation that anyone interested in cybersecurity can use and adapt. Consequently, I will include a wide range of topics and implementations, ensuring the repository is not limited to only specific aspects of cybersecurity.
